<p>In fact, Sentinel already build-in support dynamic datasource ðŸ‘‡</p>

</ul>
<p>Sentinel official suggested that the dynamic rules pushed by sentinel-datasource rather than sentinel-client,
like the following ðŸ‘‡

Howeve my demand is making the flowRules change according to the business data rather than my operation on the sentinel-dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="transform-the-interaction-between-systems">Transform the interaction between systems</h2>
<p>So we need transform the interaction between sentinel-client, etcd server and sentinet-dashboard, like the following
(i used the etcd as the dynamic datasource)ðŸ‘‡
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yan1025/picbed/master/picbed/%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D%E6%96%87%E4%BB%B6%20(90).png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common steps between offical suggested and my practice, we should takes one more step:
add a listener to the business data(a collection named &lsquo;Sla&rsquo; that stored in MongoDB) what builds new flowRules from the
new business data and pushs to etcd server positively. Sentinel-etcd-datasource will automatically does the rest things.</p>
<h2 id="the-bug-of-sentinel">The bug of sentinel</h2>
<p>I found a bug when i used sentinel-etcd-datasource, and i committed a pull request ðŸ‘‡
